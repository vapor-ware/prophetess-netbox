# üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Prophetess Netbox Plugin

[Prophetess](https://github.com/vapor-ware/prophetess) plugin for loading data into [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox)

# üöÄ Installation

```sh
pip install prophetess-netbox
```

# üîß Configuration

[NetboxLoader](/prophetess_netbox/loader.py#L12) takes several required and optional configuration options. The full configuration break down is presented below:

```yaml
host: 'http://localhost:8000'
api_key: 123key
update_method: update
endpoint: dcim
model: sites
pk:
- slug
- cf_id: "{site}"
fk:
  region:
    endpoint: dcim
    model: regions
    pk:
    - cf_sf_id: "{region}"
```

## Loader

| Key           | Values                        | Description  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----- |
| host          | string                        | Fully qualified URL to root of Netbox install  |
| api_key       | string                        | Valid API key for accessing Netbox resources |
| update_method | (update, partial_update)      | When updating existing records, which method to use. `update` will send all fields, `partial_update` will only submit changed values, or skip the update if no values have been updated  |
| endpoint      | string                        | The root API group to use, eg: dcim, ipam, tenant, etc |
| model         | string                        | Which Model of the endpoint to manipulate |
| pk            | string or list (pk)           | How to identify a unique record from endpoint and model. See [PK](#pk) |
| fk            | object (fk)                   | Mapping of any record fields that are related to other data models. See [FK](#fk) |


## PK

PK, Primary Key(s), are a list of strings or dictionaries (objects) on how to check if a record to be loaded exists. When using a dictionary the key is used for lookup against the API and the value is a Python formatted string. This allows for flexibility in mapping parsed record to what Netbox assumes.

For example, given the parsed record of:

```python
{
  'slug': 'nb-slug',
  'region': 'custom-field-lookup',
  'name': 'test',
}
```

With a PK config of

```yaml
- slug
- cf_region: '{region}'
```

The resulting lookup would be: `?slug=nb-slug&cf_region=custom-field-lookup`

## FK

FK, Forigen Key(s), allow for mapping of string values from an extractor to record ids in netbox. The are a dictionary of record key to a mapping of configuration for lookup. Records can be linked across any endpoint and model within a single Netbox instance.

Given the following record:

```python
{
  'slug': 'nb-slug',
  'region': 'region-slug',
  'name': 'test',
}
```

When parsed with the following FK configuration:

```yaml
region:
  endpoint: dcim
  model: regions
  pk:
  - slug
```

Would produce, assuming there was a region with the slug `region-slug` that had a record ID of 12:

```python
{
  'slug': 'nb-slug',
  'region': 12,
  'name': 'test',
}
```

If no FK record is found, `None` is set instead.

### Config

| Key           | Values                        | Description  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----- |
| endpoint      | string                        | The root API group to use, eg: dcim, ipam, tenant, etc |
| model         | string                        | Which Model of the endpoint to manipulate |
| pk            | string or list (pk)           | How to identify a unique record from endpoint and model. See [PK](#pk) |
